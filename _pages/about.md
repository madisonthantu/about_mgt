## About Me

Hi there and welcome to my website! 

My name is Madison and I recently obtained my M.S. degree in Computer Science (CS) from Columbia University in December 2023, during which I pursued the program's Machine Learning track. I am also one of three 2021 fellows of the [Lustgarten Whitney Family Fellowship's 2021 cohort](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/news/asif-soeyadi-thantu-lustgarten-whitney-fellows), which was awarded by Columbia University's Computer Science Department.

I graduated from UCLA in 2021, where I obtained a B.S. in Cognitive Science and a B.A. in Human Biology and Society. Clearly, I gravitate towards interdisciplinary fields, and I typically describe my undergrad coursework as a blend of Computer Science, Psychology, Biology, and Sociology.

Through my coursework at UCLA, I became extremely interested in technology public policy and ethics, specifically cyclical interaction between technology, society, and the individual. Deciding to pursue this passion, I began Columbia University's [Bridge program](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/) upon graduating from UCLA. This program was designed to help support highly qualified students from underrepresented and nontraditional backgrounds as they pursue a career in computer science.

I hope to use my interdisciplinary approach throughout my academic and professional pursuits in the field of computer science, ultimately to create and advocate for technology that is prosocial, equitable, and empowering.
 
A silly fact for you - the favicon of this site is of my sphynx (i.e., hairless) cat named Drogon. You can call him Khal for short.
