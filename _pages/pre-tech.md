### My CS Journey

Prior to pursuing a career in technology, I was deeply entrenched in the social sciences and humanities. My interdisciplinary degree program(s) at UCLA allowed me to take some really awesome classes, like *Problems of Identity at the Biology/Society Interface* or *Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications of Cognitive Neuroscience*, and a few slightly bizarre ones: I took Metaphysics while abroad at the University College London, and my entire grade was determined by a paper where I argued *in favor* for the possibility of time travel.
