Hi there, and welcome to my website! My name is Madison and I am a first-year Master's student in Computer Science (CS) at Columbia University, with an expected graduation date of December 2023.

I am currently pursuing the Machine Learning track of Columbia's MS in CS program. I am also a fellow of the [Lustgarten Whitney Family Fellowship's 2021 cohort](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/news/asif-soeyadi-thantu-lustgarten-whitney-fellows). This program was designed to help support highly qualified students from underrepresented and nontraditional backgrounds as they pursue a career in computer science through Columbia University's [Bridge program](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/). I hope to use my interdisciplinary approach throughout my academic and professional pursuits in the field of computer science, ultimately to create and advocate for technology that is prosocial, equitable, and empowering.

 I graduated from UCLA in 2021, where I obtained a B.S. in Cognitive Science and a B.A. in Human Biology and Society. Clearly, I gravitate towards interdisciplinary fields, and I typically describe my undergrad coursework as a blend of Computer Science, Psychology, Biology, and Sociology. 
 
 A silly fact for you - the favicon of this site is of my sphynx (i.e., hairless) cat named Drogon. You can call him Khal for short.
